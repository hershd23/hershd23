I am currently pursuing my **Masters in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology**. 

I also work in the DB Lab at Georgia Tech where I work on EvaDB, a database system for AI applications where we can plug and play with ML models and build pipelines in declarative SQL syntax. 

I used to work at **Flipkart in their Cloud Team** and provided Infrastructure as a Service to the rest of the teams at Flipkart.

- ðŸ”­ I am also working on CUDA programming, GPU memory management and Football Analytics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot about how to create reliable systems and deploying Machine Learning models at scale
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any PPML or Football Analytics based ideas
- I am currently contributing to [EvaDB](https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/evadb). Hit me up on EvaDB slack if you wish to talk about these projects or want to contribute yourself
